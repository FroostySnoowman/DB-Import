# DB Import

This is a simple python script that imports your sql files into a MySQL database. You define the file you want to import and where you want that file to import to in the config.yml file. The import process will start and import the data.

To back up any of your MySQL files, simply use my DB Backups script found here: https://github.com/FroostySnoowman/DB-Backups
